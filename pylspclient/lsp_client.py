        The initialize request is sent as the first request from the client to the server. If the server receives a request or notification

        1. For a request the response should be an error with code: -32002. The message can be picked by the server.
        2. Notifications should be dropped, except for the exit notification. This will allow the exit of a server without an initialize request.
        
        Until the server has responded to the initialize request with an InitializeResult, the client must not send any additional requests or 
        notifications to the server. In addition the server is not allowed to send any requests or notifications to the client until it has responded 
        with an InitializeResult, with the exception that during the initialize request the server is allowed to send the notifications window/showMessage, 
        window/logMessage and telemetry/event as well as the window/showMessageRequest request to the client.

        The initialize request may only be sent once.

        not be sent more than once without a corresponding close notification send before. This means open and close notification must be
